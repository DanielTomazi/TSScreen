# Tomazi Screen - Serviço de Streaming
Streaming Service Created with Java
***
Version 1.0 – Initial projection of a streaming platform using the Java programming language with encapsulation methods, setters and getters, and other methods and features. (The project will have future updates).
***
Version 1.1 – Encapsulation techniques, polymorphism, and the interface context, commonly used in Java, were applied to the code. This expanded the number of classes, as visible in the "Source" package. (The code will continue to expand).
***
Version 1.2 – The "TS Plus Max" directory was removed from the repository due to updates and fixes applied directly in the code through IntelliJ. A new directory called "Tomazi Screen" was added, presenting all the functionalities and features previously offered by the code.
***
Version 1.3 – New code was added using ArrayList and List functions, along with references to LinkedList, working with grouped data in the code, sorting and re-sorting them based on specific criteria. (Some files are still in version 1.7 as they have not needed to be or have not yet been updated).
***
Version 1.4 – New features were added using APIs, through Google's Gson library. This feature allows fetching any movie and displaying its information, thus optimizing the software's back-end. A code snippet was also implemented to identify and report specific errors that the tool might encounter.
***
Version 1.5 – New functionalities were added using try/catch functions to anticipate unavoidable errors when configuring the back-end of the code. A new function was also added to store searched titles in a separate document, either in text or JSON format.
